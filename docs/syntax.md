# 📜 **FLOWLANG ARCANE GRIMOIRE**

### *— The Forbidden Tome of Codecraft & Mana Weaving —*

*(Aka: Syntax Reference but written like a magical spellbook 😏🔥)*

---

# 🌬️ **I. SCRIPTING SIGILS (Comments)**

Even ancient mages needed footnotes.
Use comments to explain your future self why you wrote this mess.

```flowlang
-- Whispered note to self
/* Ancient runes */
```

**🗡️ *Note:*
"Good. Comment your code. Someone has to understand it, and it clearly won't be you in 3 days."**

---

# 🔮 **II. ESSENCE VESSELS (Variables)**

Containers for your unstable emotional energy.

```flowlang
let power = 9000
seal MAX = 10000
```

**🗡️ *Note:*
"You change variables more often than your life decisions."**

---

# 🌌 **III. ESSENCE FORMS (Data Types)**

Every value has an Essence. Unlike you, they know what they are.

```flowlang
let name: Silk = "Flow"
```

**🗡️ *Note:*
"At least the variables have identity. Can't say the same about your projects."**

---

# ⚔️ **IV. ARCANE OPERATORS**

Symbols you mash hoping the output becomes correct.

```flowlang
is~  -- equal in spirit
not~ -- you're wrong
```

**🗡️ *Note:*
"Using operators responsibly? Bold of you to assume you won't break something."**

---

# 🧠 **V. STANCE WEAVING (Conditionals)**

Reality-bending branches that decide whether your code works or explodes.

```flowlang
in Stance (power >> 9000) { ... }
```

**🗡️ *Note:*
"Your ‘if’ statements have clearer boundaries than your relationships."**

---

# ♾️ **VI. PHASE LOOPS (Loops)**

Great for repeating tasks…
just like the bugs you keep introducing.

```flowlang
enter Phase i from 1 to 10 { ... }
```

**🗡️ *Note:*
"Ah yes, infinite loops. Just like your overthinking habits."**

---

# 🪄 **VII. SPELLCRAFT (Functions)**

Encapsulated magic.
You know, instead of writing everything in `main()` like a goblin.

```flowlang
cast Spell greet(name) { ... }
```

**🗡️ *Note:*
"Congrats, you just created a function. Too bad you still can’t function."**

---

# 📦 **VIII. CIRCLE RUNES (Modules)**

Importing wisdom from other scrolls
because writing everything yourself was clearly not happening.

```flowlang
circle fs from "std:file"
```

**🗡️ *Note:*
"Good. Reuse code. Your originality is… concerning."**

---

# 🌙 **IX. RITUALS OF TIME (Async/Await)**

Summon spirits, wait for them, pretend you understand concurrency.

```flowlang
await fetchData()
```

**🗡️ *Note:*
"Finally something you’re good at: waiting while doing nothing."**

---

# 💀 **X. ERROR ARC (Rifts & Panics)**

When your code goes *boom*, at least FlowLang lets you blame a rift in the timeline.

```flowlang
rupture Rift "No connection"
```

**🗡️ *Note:*
"Your errors have more drama than your entire love life."**

---

# 🌟 **XI. CONSTELLATION ARTS (Arrays)**

Star clusters of data.
Don’t mess it up… too late.

```flowlang
nums.constellation(x -> x * 2)
```

**🗡️ *Note:*
"Mapping arrays: because manually fixing your own mistakes is too hard."**

---

# 🧿 **XII. THE GRAND EXAMPLE**

```flowlang
cast Spell factorial(n) -> Ember { ... }
```

**🗡️ *Note:*
"Nice recursive function. Too bad your brain stack overflows after 3 steps."**
